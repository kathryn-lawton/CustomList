Welcome to my CustomList program. In this program I create a generic List class and
create several of the built-in C# List methods. This program was built using 
test-driven development and implements an Add, Remove, Override ToString, Overload + Operator,
Overload - Operator, and Zip method. I also implemented an indexer, Count property, and IEnumberable interface
so that I am able properly implement my methods.
